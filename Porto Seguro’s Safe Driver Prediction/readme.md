# Kaggle private score 0.29171(15th place)

Assembled the top 1% kernel(private score 0.288) and other kernels that have been published.

This kernel is similar to the top 1% kernel referenced.

As far as I know, it did better than all the jupyter notebook kernels published.

There may be a better score Juputer-notebook kernel I have not seen.
