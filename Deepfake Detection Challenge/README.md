I won my first kaggle bronze medal at the DFDC competition.

I haven't done much because of the Bengali competition and the M5 competition(ongoing), but I'm glad I got a bronze medal.
Studying in the school's medical vision lab was very helpful.

I only used Resnext and Xception, and Efficientnet B0 did not learning due to lack of time.
Opinion of other participants, I would be able to challenge the silver medal if I used B0 or others.
I should have made more diverse models for the competition.
